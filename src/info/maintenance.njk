		<p>Clients sometimes ask why I charge a yearly fee for website/CMS maintenance and what does it include. In the past, web technology was simpler and websites tended to work without the need for regular maintenance. Today, however, web technology is much more complex and there are more people looking to exploit weaknesses of outdated software from every angle. This puts everyone, from individuals to large corporations, at risk.</p>

		<p>Leaving software and tools to become outdated can also cause major headaches and increased costs in the future. Websites are collections of many different technologies that need to be monitored and kept up to date to prevent issues further down the line. By regularly maintaining a website I can deal with these issues, which we can “breaking changes”, quickly and efficiently.</p>

		<p>With this in mind, I provide website maintenance at a reasonable yearly cost. This offers peace of mind and keeps websites in top shape. My basic package covers CMS updates installed fortnightly (with critical updates installed ASAP), management of hosting and security patches, software updates, and SSL certificate renewals, website up-time monitoring (every minute), broken link monitoring, SEO health checks, bug fixes, performance monitoring, database and file backups.</p>

		<p>In summary, website maintenance is essential in today’s complex web environment. Outdated software and tools can cause major issues and put websites at risk of exploitation. By providing regular maintenance, I can help prevent problems before they occur and ensure that websites are running smoothly.</p>
