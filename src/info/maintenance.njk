		<p>In today’s digital landscape, maintaining a website isn’t merely an option—it’s a necessity. Gone are the days when websites could function effectively without regular upkeep. Modern websites rely on complex technologies, which require constant attention to prevent vulnerabilities and ensure optimal performance.</p>

		<h2 class="spacer-b-lg font-bold tracking-[-0.0125em] text-white text-heading">Why Annual Maintenance Fees?</h2>

		<p>You might wonder why there’s an annual fee for maintaining your website. This fee covers a range of essential services that protect your investment:</p>

		<ol class="list-decimal pl-8 space-y-4">
			<li><strong>Regular Updates:</strong> Every two weeks, I update your Content Management System (CMS) to ensure it performs efficiently. Critical updates are applied immediately to safeguard against potential threats.</li>

			<li>Security and Performance: I manage hosting services, apply security patches, and renew SSL certificates to protect your site from vulnerabilities. I also monitor website uptime every minute to ensure it’s always accessible, and investigate any issues if and when they might appear.</li>

			<li>Monitoring and Fixes: Broken links can harm your website’s credibility and SEO. I monitor and fix these along with performing regular SEO health checks. I also handle bug fixes to keep everything running smoothly.</li>

			<li>Backups: To prevent data loss, multiple, regular backups of your website’s database and files are conducted.</li>
		</ol>

		<p>Unfortunatly, I’ve dealt with the results of companies who neglected regular maintenance. Falling behind in updates left their websites unable to support critical security fixes, making them vulnerable to threats. In some cases, entire websites had to be rebuilt from scratch due to outdated software or plugins that weren’t addressed in time. This underscores the importance of proactive maintenance to keep your site secure and operational.</p>

		<p>By investing in these services, you limit the costly repercussions of outdated software and unaddressed technical issues.</p>

		<p>Maintaining a website is about being proactive, not reactive. With my maintenance services, you can rest easy knowing your online presence is always in good hands.
