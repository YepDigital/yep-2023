"><p dir="ltr"><strong>Sometimes a client will understandably ask why I charge an additional yearly cost for maintenance, shouldn't the site just work? </strong></p><p dir="ltr">Back in the early days of the web this was the case (to an extent), technology was simpler and there were fewer people using it. Today's web has become considerably more complex and with many people out there looking to exploit weaknesses and outdated software for nefarious reasons. These people (sometimes organisations) target everyone from my granny to multi-billion dollar corporations with state of the art security and redundancy in place.</p><p dir="ltr">Problems from lack of maintenance don't end there however, simply running out-of-date software or tools can introduce major headaches and increased costs in the future. Websites are a collection of many different technologies that should be monitored and kept up to date to ensure nothing will break further down the line. While maintaining a site I may actively encounter a "breaking change" which I can deal with or plan for there and then rather than months or years down the line.</p><p dir="ltr">With this knowledge in mind and past experience helping unfortunate companies recover broken websites. I provide website maintenance at a reasonable yearly cost that offers peace of mind and your website kept in top shape.</p><p dir="ltr">Currently my yearly package covers the following:</p><ul><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://yep.digital/index.php?p=info/hosting">Website hosting</a></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr">CMS updates installed fortnightly with critical updates installed ASAP</p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr">Management of security patches, software updates and SSL certificates on the server</p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr">Website up-time monitoring (every minute)</p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr">Broken link monitoring</p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr">SEO health checks</p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr">Bug fixes when identified</p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr">Regular performance checks</p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr">Regular database backups (four hourly or daily depending on the site)</p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr">Daily file backups</p></li></ul><hr /><p dir="ltr">Three step update process:</p><ol><li>The site is first updated <em>locally</em> on my development laptop, I check everything is working and no problems have occured or deal with those that have.</li><li>The update is then deployed to the <em>staging</em> server where I run the same checks again. The staging server is a closer replication of the live server than a local machine so this step is not skipped.</li><li>Finally the update is deployed to the <em>live</em> (aka production) server after the database has been backed up, caches are cleared, the site is checked and monitors reviewed for any issues.</li></ol><p>There are more details involved in the complete process but this should give a general overview of how updates are run and issues avoided.</p></div></div></section>
