		<p>In today’s digital world, maintaining a website is essential. The time when websites could operate effectively without regular upkeep is long gone. Modern websites rely on complex technologies that require ongoing attention to prevent vulnerabilities and ensure top performance.</p>

		<h2 class="font-bold tracking-[-0.0125em] text-white text-heading spacer-t-xs">Why Annual Maintenance Fees?</h2>

		<p>You might wonder why there’s an ongoing cost for maintaining your website. This covers a range of essential services that protect your website:</p>

		<ol class="space-y-4">
			<li><strong class="font-semibold text-white/90 block">Regular Updates:</strong> Every two weeks, I install updates to your Content Management System (CMS) to ensure it performs efficiently. Critical updates are applied immediately to guard against potential threats.</li>

			<li><strong class="font-semibold text-white/90 block">Security and Performance:</strong> I manage the web hosting services, apply security patches, and renew SSL certificates to keep your website secure. I also monitor website uptime by the minute to ensure your website is always available, and proactively investigate any issues that might appear.</li>

			<li><strong class="font-semibold text-white/90 block">Monitoring and Fixes:</strong> Broken links can harm your website’s credibility and SEO. I monitor and fix these while performing regular SEO health checks. I also proactively fix "bugs" if they appear, to keep everything running smoothly.</li>

			<li><strong class="font-semibold text-white/90 block">Backups:</strong> To prevent data loss, multiple backups of your website’s files and data is conducted on daily basis and stored in multiple secure locations.</li>

			<li><strong class="font-semibold text-white/90 block">Support:</strong> I'm also here to offer technical support whenever you're stuck, need a small change or update to your site, or simply seeking advice related to your website or online presence.</li>
		</ol>

		<p>Unfortunately, I've experienced the consequences of companies neglecting regular maintenance. Falling behind with updates meant their websites couldn't support crucial security fixes, leaving them vulnerable to threats. In some instances, entire websites had to be rebuilt from scratch because outdated software was not addressed in time.</p>

		<p>By investing in these maintenance, you can avoid more expensive consequences of outdated software and unresolved technical issues further down the road.</p>

		<p>Maintaining a website is about being proactive, and you can be confident that your online presence is well-managed. If you have questions or need assistance, feel free to reach out to me at <a href="mailto:ryan@yep.digital">ryan@yep.digital</a>.</p>
