		<p>Here's the pitch! I create robust, on-brand websites that deliver your message and fit business requirements by combining two decades of experience, the flexibility and low overheads of being a freelancer, and quite simply a desire to do good work for good people. I create websites that work for you and your customers.</p>

		{#
		Over the past 20 years within the Scottish design industry, I've built a wealth of experience working with a diverse range of clients across many sectors. The skill set I've developed, and flexibility of being freelance developer, enables me to bring that experience into tailored solutions that fit your specific business and budget requirements.

		In 2019 I established <em class="text-white not-italic">yep.digital</em>  so I could take this skill set, along with the flexibility of freelancing, and offer it small-toâ€“medium size business, organisations, and individuals. This enables me to bring tailor solutions that fit the specific business and budget requirements of my clients. Some of my recent clients include:

		I offer a range of web services, including design, CMS-powered websites, and low-budget websites. Whether you need a visually appealing and user-friendly website or a cost-effective solution for your limited budget, I've got you covered. I also provide website hosting and maintenance to ensure your website is secure, up-to-date, and running smoothly. If you need consulting and advice on web related issues, website reviews and health checks, or CMS integrations, I'm here to help. I'm open to agency partnerships and collaborating with graphic designers to deliver exceptional web solutions.
